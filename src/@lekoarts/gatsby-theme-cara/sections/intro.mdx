# Hello 👋🏼, Welcome

## Myself

My Name is Lakshma Kusam. I am working as a full stack engineer for more then 6 years. I have started as ASP.NET developer where I built web applications 🕸
as well as desktop applications 🖥 .<br/>
Using asp.net and node js I developed serval back-end services using **REST and SOAP API's**.<br/>
Learned at a lot about micro service architecture and power API and need for automation's and integrations.<br/>
Learnt about building CRM and automation's and Integrations needed for the service including but not limited to Scheduling, Messaging and Email services.

### Why I automate ? 

> As Humans there is a chance you can enter the wrong  0 or 1 which might cause the systems to break over night over period of time which involves lot of man hours in data correction.
> With a automated systems in place we can put this issue to bed 🛌

**You have two systems I can try to automate. 🙂**
